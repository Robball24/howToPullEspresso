        <h1>A Quick Guide to Pulling Espresso in a Gaggia Classic Pro </h1>

            <h2>Here is what you'll need.</h2>
    <div class="needs">
        <ul>
            <li>Gaggia Classic Pro</li>
            <li>Coffee Beans</li>
            <li>Coffee Grinder</li>
            <li>Tamper</li>
            <li>2 oz measuring glass</li>
            <li>Timer</li>    
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>Okay, let's get started!</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn the Gaggia Classic Pro on and let it warm up for 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Grind coffee beans to a fine grind, a little finer than sugar.</li>
            <li>Fill portafilter with coffee grinds, and tamp.</li>
            <li>Grab a frothing pitcher, or some container that can hold hot water.</li>
            <li>Place the container under the shower screen, and turn the brew switch until the light turns off, then turn the brew switch off.</li>
            <li>Wipe the shower screen dry, and wait for the light to turn back on.</li>
            <li>Once the light is on, turn the steam switch on for 5 seconds.</li>
            <li>Place the portafilter in its place, and place the container under the steam wand.</li>
            <li>PLace the 2 oz measuring glass under the portafilter.</li>
            <li>Turn on the steam wand, and flip the brew switch immediately after.</li>
            <li>After 7 seconds, turn the steam wand off.</li>
            <li>As soon as coffe starts to pour, start the timer.</li>
            <li>The goal is to get 2 ozs(counting the crema) in 20-30 secons.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Some Trouble Shooting!</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If your shot doesn't pull, you tamped too hard.</li>
            <li>If it pulls too quickly, then you either tamped it too soft, or more likely, didn't grind the coffee fine enough.</li>
            </ul>
